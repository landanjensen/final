        <p class="intro">   Growing up I loved being outside and was decently athletic so my mom put me in sports
        but i never really took a liking to the sports I did. So I have a lot of weird 
        sports skill. I didn't really accomplish much besides the fact that doing sports
    encouraged me to stay healthy and fit so i could enjoy the other wonders the world 
    has to offer<br></p>
